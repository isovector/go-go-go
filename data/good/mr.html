He was recently named in an Economist poll as one of the most influential economists of the last decade and several years ago Bloomberg BusinessWeek dubbed him \"America's Hottest Economist.\" Foreign Policy magazine named him as one of its \"Top 100 Global Thinkers\" of 2011.

    <p>One of the most common intellectual mistakes!</p>
<p>Do note however that it is an efficient mistake for many people to commit, and that is part of why it is so common.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once-and-for-allism&#8221; occurs when people decide that they wish to stop worrying about an issue at the margin.Â  They might either dismiss the issue, or they might blow up its importance but regard the issue as hopeless and undeserving of further consideration.Â  Either way, they seek to avoid the hovering sense of &#8220;I&#8217;ve still got to devote time and energy to figuring this out.&#8221;Â  They prefer &#8220;I am now done with this issue, once and for all!&#8221;Â  Thus the name of the syndrome.</p>
<p>I see once-and-for-allism with so many issues, but one recent example would be <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2022/05/the-new-covid-equilibrium.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the forthcoming path of Covid and Long Covid</a>.Â  Most people just don&#8217;t want to think about it any more, and so they settle on <em>something</em> (&#8220;it&#8217;s just a cold!&#8221; or &#8220;it will bankrupt the nation!&#8221;) rather than having to do lots of intellectual revisions based on the stream of new data.</p>
<p>Other examples of topics that attract once-and-for-all thinking would be crypto, demographic decline, long-run fiscal solvency, various foreign policy crises, biodiversity, AI issues, the Repugnant Conclusion and Non-Identity Problems, whether we are living in a simulation, UFOs, abortion, what is the person&#8217;s ultimate normative standard, and much more.</p>
<p>People won&#8217;t let these topics take up too much of their mind space.Â  But neither can they do the Bayesian detachment thing, and so they shunt these topics into settled categories and put them aside.</p>
<p>If you are trying to figure out a thinker and his or her defects, see if you can spot that person&#8217;s &#8220;once-and-for-all&#8221; moves.Â  There will be plenty of them.</p>

You never mention Julian Assange. Zero oxygen.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Jeff Epstein. What\u2019s up with that?&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;},{&quot;id&quot;:160457240,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;Neurotic&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:1,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:1,&quot;downboops&quot;:0,&quot;vote_count&quot;:1,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-06-26 15:19:44&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:0,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Expected to see comments to the effect that much (most?) belief about abortion legality is moral not \&quot;intellectual\&quot;. TC&#039;s claim that whatever position a person has, if s\/he isn&#039;t willing to update it, is an intellectual mistake is incorrect. It&#039;s nonsense, and surely TC knows it, to suggest, for example, that the Laws of Thermodynamics should be considered tentative. (Although what he means by \&quot;at the margin\&quot;, I have no idea.  I doubt whether he could articulate a coherent explanation - except in terms of \&quot;what is settled (once and for all) and what is not.)&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;},{&quot;id&quot;:160457212,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;Tom Meadowcroft&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:1,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:1,&quot;downboops&quot;:0,&quot;vote_count&quot;:1,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-06-26 14:25:50&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:0,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Isn&#039;t once and for all -ism much the same as faith?  Not a particular religion, because that dictates a list of certain faith items that you and a bunch of other people agree to hold in common.  But we all engage in faith as a way to handle complexity and fear of the unknown.  When we are either reasonably sure of something, or we need to stop worrying about something about which we have little control (stress and fear are harmful to your health and bad for decision making), humans have the ability to take things on faith, and stop thinking too much about them.  Even Einstein believed in a \&quot;benevolent universe\&quot;; we all use faith as a tool.  Once-and-for-all-ism is an intellectual crutch, true, but an essential tool if one is to live a happy and productive life, free to focus on those things where we have sufficient data and agency to affect change.  We can choose to be atheists, but nobody can afford to abandon faith; too useful.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;},{&quot;id&quot;:160457178,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;Invisible Sun&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:1,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:1,&quot;downboops&quot;:0,&quot;vote_count&quot;:1,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-06-26 13:13:35&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:0,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Blame Putin.

Last I saw, the evidence of its existence was very mixed.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s interesting when this blog has been contrarian on COVID19. At the beginning when certain COVID10 positions hadn&#039;t yet hardened to dogma, and now towards the end, when people don&#039;t really care anymore. In both cases, low reputational  risk, low impact.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;children&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:160457191,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;Neurotic&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:1,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:3,&quot;downboops&quot;:2,&quot;vote_count&quot;:5,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-06-26 13:48:34&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:1,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Anyone whose mental tools includes the meme \&quot;scientifically proven\&quot; has need of a better education.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;children&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:160457210,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;chrisare&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:0,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:2,&quot;downboops&quot;:2,&quot;vote_count&quot;:4,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-06-26 14:20:19&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:2,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;I dare say anyone who mistakes word choice in a blog post comment for mental tools has need of a better education.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;}],&quot;childrenIDs&quot;:[160457210]}],&quot;childrenIDs&quot;:[160457191,160457210]},{&quot;id&quot;:160457145,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;Prester John&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:3,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:3,&quot;downboops&quot;:0,&quot;vote_count&quot;:3,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-06-26 11:12:06&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:0,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Shrug. This strikes me as an outside-in observation. Cowen sees people who seem not to care about new data on a particular issue and assume they just made up their minds permanently and ignore further evidence. Maybe some have, but maybe the stream of new data is poor quality.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Take COVID sequelae. I essentially ignore it at this point because most of the evidence is sparse and poor quality. The best quality evidence indicates that it is not annihilating brains or lungs on a permanent basis, and indeed that (like many other mysterious maladies: fibromyalgia, CFS, chronic Lyme, IBS) it\u2019s a diagnosis of exclusion. This places it, on a scale of all the things that require my attention, near the bottom of the priority scale. As time goes by without significant evidence to reverse this perception, the threshold that evidence needs to clear in order to change our opinions on what we have seen so far must climb higher and higher.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;children&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:160457175,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;Also helps fend off gaslighting&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:3,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:5,&quot;downboops&quot;:2,&quot;vote_count&quot;:7,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-06-26 12:38:03&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:1,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Makes a lot of sense to (e.g.) ignore anything COVID going forward, rather than allow others to abuse your good faith by distracting\/worrying with nonsense (that anyone operating in good faith would flag as questionable, uncertain, etc., but instead is always presented as doom! comply now!). Seriously, Tyler picked about the worst example: COVID was a non-issue for almost everyone. Where I sit, 1 in 1000 died per year, almost every single one very old, very sick, and very fat. Normal people never should have bothered, let alone kids. But Tyler still wants us to factor COVID into our calculus? No thanks, I&#039;ve got better things to think about.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;}],&quot;childrenIDs&quot;:[160457175]},{&quot;id&quot;:160457138,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;Tom O&#039;Brien&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:1,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:2,&quot;downboops&quot;:1,&quot;vote_count&quot;:3,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-06-26 10:58:18&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:0,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Like most people most of the time there is no potential future in which my thoughts about UFOs, BLM, cryptocurrency, Ukraine, abortion, anti-vax, life on Mars, etc will have any effect outside of my head. Most peoples&#039; interest in the issues of the day is purely recreational. When it stops being interesting, move on. If it begins to be interesting again, update.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;},{&quot;id&quot;:160457113,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;rene saenz&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:0,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:0,&quot;downboops&quot;:0,&quot;vote_count&quot;:0,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-06-26 09:19:37&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:0,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;The question, I think, is fundamentally whether one thinks they are choosing their future when choosing their past, and, if so, to what degree they wish that future to be open\/narrow, vague\/detailed, etc.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If one had a history of instability, they would not want an open or vague future. It&#039;s a reasonable trade-off in the present. Habit can adjust to any situation, however horrifying or immoral, but (again, in the present) loss is loss.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;},{&quot;id&quot;:160457112,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;Skeptical American&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:14,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:14,&quot;downboops&quot;:0,&quot;vote_count&quot;:14,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-06-26 09:16:46&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:0,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Does \u2018The Science Is Settled\u2019 count as \u2018once-and-for-allism\u2019?&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Asking for a whole bunch of (recent) college graduates.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;},{&quot;id&quot;:160457110,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;rene saenz&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:0,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:0,&quot;downboops&quot;:0,&quot;vote_count&quot;:0,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-06-26 08:56:00&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:0,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;the implicit trade here is whether the person in question is willing to accept the imagined consequences of full bayesian reasoning. like anything, this comes down to their expectations of their own success relative to what they pay. Some have low expectations and don&#039;t believe in \&quot;partially probabilistic\&quot; reasoning for everyday life, so they move on. Gain ability to cope and charge ahead. Lose ability to consider the ufo.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;the obvious rebuttal is that those driven by internal principles rather than outside incentives can cope with uncertainty for their personal greater good.

Better the awful one knows than change to what one doesn&#039;t. I sometimes comment that people enjoy re-writing history: they must, because they spend a lot of time doing it. Alas, they are no better at predicting the past than they are at predicting the future. Fondness for the past is bad enough, but it&#039;s usually a past that never existed. Fear of the future is the corollary to fondness for the past. As Cowen reminds us, it often takes disruption to make the leap to the future; thus, Cowen&#039;s fondness for disruptors. Today&#039;s leading disruptors, however, wish to leap to the past, to erase what has been and return to a past that never existed.

Also, persons low in the sub facet of the Openness to Experience dimension of personality known as Need for Cognition will presumably be inclined toward low elaboration of making sense of topics and using simple heuristics arrive at conclusions with feeling much in the way of a need to explore further.

Probably the biggest difference between a PhD and a Mastwrs in the same subject. Similar subject matter learned but the PhD also has dedicated an extra few years on a project. Most projects in industry take years of focus. Hypothetically let\u2019s say everyone did a real PhD (not a diploma mill EdD or similar), then the idea of focusing on Covid for more than 2 years would be a breeze. In fact we could easily set up a monitoring system for when we need to allot some time for it vs not.

That\u2019s why solutions have either been absolutely draconian or none at all. Draconian policies attempt to solve the problem quickly so we can stop thinking about it.

One hope that those with responsibility have had the training and focus you rightly ascribe to those who&#039;ve gone through the PhD process for, say, mathematics. If the average person detaches from an issue out of mental exhaustion, that&#039;s to be expected: kind of like what happens to students when you work through an integral at the board that involves trig substitutions...and integration by parts. Those with responsibility can not detach in the way TC describes and they have to accept and...plan for the average person to do just that: kind of like a calculus teacher.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;children&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:160457159,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;Math PhD&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:2,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:2,&quot;downboops&quot;:0,&quot;vote_count&quot;:2,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-06-26 11:44:40&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:3,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;I think that\u2019s a fair criticism.

I think average people were unhappy but more patient than they have been given credit for, and I think scientific policy makers were nervous that they\u2019d lose consent if they weren\u2019t fast and acting as forcefully as possible in to the temporary hype generated by the media, and I think the media were stoking anxiety in both the average people and the science policy establishment for the media\u2019s amusement, benefit, and long term goals of national division.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;}],&quot;childrenIDs&quot;:[160457159]}],&quot;childrenIDs&quot;:[160457023,160457159]}],&quot;childrenIDs&quot;:[160457001,160457023,160457159]},{&quot;id&quot;:160456997,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;Tommy&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:22,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:22,&quot;downboops&quot;:0,&quot;vote_count&quot;:22,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-06-26 00:33:51&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:0,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;What are your once-and-for-all issues, Tyler?&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;children&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:160457127,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;peri&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:1,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:1,&quot;downboops&quot;:0,&quot;vote_count&quot;:1,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-06-26 10:12:26&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:1,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;I don&#039;t think once-and-for-all-ism would be very good for T.C.&#039;s business model.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;},{&quot;id&quot;:160457121,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;Dirty Harry&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:7,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:7,&quot;downboops&quot;:0,&quot;vote_count&quot;:7,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-06-26 09:57:44&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:1,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;\&quot;Markets are self-correcting\&quot;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;},{&quot;id&quot;:160457043,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;Mar&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:-6,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:3,&quot;downboops&quot;:9,&quot;vote_count&quot;:12,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-06-26 03:27:30&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:1,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;I can think of a few.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Gun violence &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Rising Latin American-style caudillismo on the US right &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The future role of the US in the world and foreign policy generally&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;},{&quot;id&quot;:160457002,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;The5chord&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:12,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:12,&quot;downboops&quot;:0,&quot;vote_count&quot;:12,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-06-26 00:44:34&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:1,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;That you should be against once-and-for-allism&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;}],&quot;childrenIDs&quot;:[160457127,160457121,160457043,160457002]},{&quot;id&quot;:160456995,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;Phil S.&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:49,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:63,&quot;downboops&quot;:14,&quot;vote_count&quot;:77,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-06-26 00:23:25&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:0,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Thinking capacity\/bandwidth is finite.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Humans can&#039;t be considering all the issues, all the time.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Issues arise, folks think about them, come to a conclusion, and move on.

Rather than \&quot;shunt these topics into settled categories\&quot; the correct approach is to file the issue under \&quot;unresolved hard problem\&quot;. Moving on because you can not make progress on a specific problem is rationale, insisting that the issue is resolved so that you can move on is an irrational coping mechanism, IMO.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;children&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:160457094,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;Anonymous&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:3,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:3,&quot;downboops&quot;:0,&quot;vote_count&quot;:3,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-06-26 07:38:55&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:2,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s a bit of a fine point of language, so perhaps I can expand and render the issue a bit more explicitly. &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Sometimes one must come to a &#039;conclusion&#039; (judgment, decision, etc.) because it is necessary to render a judgment within a timeframe and\/or other matters rely on a judgment being made. In any case, making a decision on best available data and reasoning (and then moving on) is all one can do; but it is an error to assume that a non-provably-perfect decision or solution was\/is permanent or will always remain functional. It is an under-mentioned error that is very common in human thinking; the inability to continue to hold such conclusions as &#039;provisional&#039;, &#039;temporary&#039;, and\/or &#039;probabilistic&#039; rather than &#039;permanent&#039; or &#039;fixed.&#039;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Dismissively insisting (as opposed to genuinely believing) that the issue is concretely and permanently solved is a different matter; this may not be an irrational cope but instead a rhetorical instrument to move on to other issues where our limited resources of time and effort can be put to better use.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;}],&quot;childrenIDs&quot;:[160457094]},{&quot;id&quot;:160457034,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;Steve Sailer&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:-9,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:24,&quot;downboops&quot;:33,&quot;vote_count&quot;:57,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-06-26 02:43:46&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:1,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Consider one of Tyler&#039;s examples: UFOs. &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Over the last several decades, there has been a proliferation of phone and security cameras in increasing high quality. This has led to Youtube being full of amazing video of, say, pets doing the darnedest things. This has led me to change my views somewhat on animals.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, I&#039;m not seeing a lot of remarkable UFO footage on Youtube. All I&#039;m seeing is lo-fi video from the military.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m not seeing much reason to get excited over UFOs.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;children&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:160457122,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;JWatts&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:0,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:0,&quot;downboops&quot;:0,&quot;vote_count&quot;:0,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-06-26 10:01:39&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:2,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;https:\/\/www.iheart.com\/content\/2020-02-03-commercial-pilot-films-ufo-flying-near-plane\/&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\&quot; His name is Cesar and he flies Airbus A320s for Viva Air, a low-cost Colombian airline. While soaring over Medellin recently, Cesar saw a strange craft and decided to film it. He then shared the footage on TikTok.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It shows a metallic cube that seems to be moving at a high rate of speed, even though it doesn&#039;t have any noticeable wings, tail or exhaust.\&quot;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;},{&quot;id&quot;:160457086,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;RAD&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:2,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:4,&quot;downboops&quot;:2,&quot;vote_count&quot;:6,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-06-26 07:20:33&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:2,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;All I&#039;m seeing is lo-fi video from the military.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Improved video resolution will not help us solve the Tic Tac UAP puzzle; the resolution is good enough to convince me that it is unlikely to have been doctored. The video footage is of the weapons system display that integrates data from infrared and radar sensors. The sensor data is backed by pilot observations. &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I think laser-induced plasma from undisclosed navy technology is the most parsimonious explanation but this hypothesis requires additional evidence. My issue is that we jump to conclusions about aliens without any thought to the plasma hypothesis.

He&#039;s very clear about that: \&quot;People won\u2019t let these topics take up too much of their mind space.  But neither can they do the Bayesian detachment thing, and so they shunt these topics into settled categories and put them aside.\&quot;  And again: \&quot;and so they shunt these topics into settled categories and put them aside.\&quot;  The labeling hardly matters when the avowed purpose is to put the topic aside: I could shrug my shoulders instead and their would be no practical difference. That is what he characterizes as an \&quot;intellectual mistake\&quot;, God knows how.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;children&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:160457117,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;steve&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:2,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:2,&quot;downboops&quot;:0,&quot;vote_count&quot;:2,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-06-26 09:34:32&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:3,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;I agree here with the sentiment. You only have so much time. That plus you would be paralyzed into inaction if you decided nothing is settled so I dont know what to do. So today I ordered some therapies for people because I think the current state of knowledge says it is the best course fully knowing that sometime in the future Bones is likely to call what I ordered barbaric. So day to day I need to act like it is once and for all. When new information comes out I will change. &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now if Tyler is really just criticizing those who wont consider new information at all then he has a point. This is especially annoying in economics where someone will cite something from 50 years ago as proof that something has been settled once and for all. Rarely is science settled and even less so for economic issues. &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Steve&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Steve&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;children&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:160457134,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;skyzyks&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:0,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:0,&quot;downboops&quot;:0,&quot;vote_count&quot;:0,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-06-26 10:44:20&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:4,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Well stated.  You distinguish, as do I, between the summary, or provisional judgment and the stubborn attachment.  I don&#039;t see TC making that distinction. As presented, a summary judgment, in particular for the purpose of disengaging, is categorized as an intellectual mistake.  The future may show that judgment to be incorrect but that doesn&#039;t make it an intellectual mistake like a fallacy in reasoning.  &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I take this be TC of the book \&quot;Talent\&quot; recommending a heuristic for evaluating people: \&quot;If you are trying to figure out a thinker and his or her defects, see if you can spot that person\u2019s &#039;once-and-for-all&#039; moves.  There will be plenty of them.\&quot;   Defects. Really? At best, you may find out what specific things interest a person and judge their taste in intellectual puzzles to be poor, but that hardly qualifies as a \&quot;defect.\&quot; Characterizing it as a defect is a normative judgment and invites the \&quot;says who\&quot; response given to attempts at normative ethics.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;}],&quot;childrenIDs&quot;:[160457134]}],&quot;childrenIDs&quot;:[160457117,160457134]}],&quot;childrenIDs&quot;:[160457013,160457010,160457117,160457134]}],&quot;childrenIDs&quot;:[160457081,160457094,160457034,160457122,160457086,160457015,160456996,160457013,160457010,160457117,160457134]}]'></div>
